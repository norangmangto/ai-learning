# What is Machine Learning?

## Major machine learning techniques

1. Classification: Predicting the item class/category of a case
2. Regression: Predicting continuous values
3. Clustering: Finding the structure of data; summarization
4. Associations: Associating frequent co-occurring items/events
5. Anomaly detection: Discovering abnormal and unusual cases
6. Sequence mining: Predicting next events; click-stream (Markov Model, HMM)
7. Dimension Reduction: Reducing the size of data (PCA)
8. Recommendation systems: Recommending items

## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

### Supervised learning

: Teaching the model with labeled data

1. Classification
2. Regression

### Unsupervised learning

1. Dimension reduction
2. Density estimation
3. Market basket analysis
4. Clustering: grouping of data points or objects that are somehow similar by:
   1. Discovering Structure
   2. Summarization
   3. Anomaly detection
