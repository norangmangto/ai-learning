# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

A support vector machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm that uses supervised learning models to solve complex classification, regression, and outlier detection problems by performing optimal data transformations that determine boundaries between data points based on predefined classes, labels, or outputs.

SVM is a supervised algorithm that classifies cases by finding a separator.

1. Mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space
2. Finding a saperator

## Kernel Functions (Kernelling)

* Linear
* Polynomial
* Radial Basis Function (RBF)
* Sigmoid

## Pros and Cons of SVM

* Pros
  * Accurate in high-dimensional spaces
  * Memory efficient
* Cons
  * Prone to over-fitting (if the number of features if much greater than the number of samples)
  * No probability estimation
  * Small datasets

## SVM applications

* Image recognition
* Text category assignment
* Detecting spam
* Sentiment analysis
* Gene Expression Classification
* Regression, outlier detection and clustering
