## Data Collection

### ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load)

## Data Preparation

* Clean data to remove irrelevant data
* Remove extreme values
* Missing values should be removed or replaced
* Each data column should be in the proper format
* Create new features
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Identify how to split up the data into training and test sets
